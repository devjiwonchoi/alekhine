# What is Equine?

Equine is minimal, zero-config, zero-dependency, asynchronous [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api) Client written in TypeScript.

Equine uses [Native Fetch API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/globals.html#fetch), which requires Node.js v18 or higher.

> Note: Equine is still in development, supporting limited endpoints for now.

## Requirements

- Node.js v18 or higher
- [Lichess API Token](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token)

## Basic Usage

```bash
npm i equine
```
  
```ts
import { Equine } from 'equine'

const lichess = new Equine('LICHESS_API_TOKEN')

// Returns the info of the account who owns the token
const accountInfo = await lichess.account.info()
```
